[h1]How it works[/h1]
Once you reach the [b][u]Dark Room[/u][/b], you can exchange all of your hearts*, coins, keys and bombs for the Mega Satan Key by stepping on the spikes on the ground.

[list]
    [*]Heart: +0.50
    [*]Coin: +0.01
    [*]Key/Bomb: +0.05
[/list]

Additional rules:
[list]
    [*]Total damage bonus is limited to +10.
    [*]The ritual will give you 1 black heart for every item from Devil Item Pool you own (max +5 black hearts in total).
    [*]If you already own 1 piece of the key, you will recive 2 additional black hearts.
    [*]If you own 1 or more items from Angel Item Pool, the ritual will [b][u]not[/u][/b] show up.
[/list]

*[u]Note[/u]: you will remain with:
[list]
    [*]1 red heart (if you have 1 or more health coontainers)
    [*]1 black heart (if you have 0 health containers)
[/list]
