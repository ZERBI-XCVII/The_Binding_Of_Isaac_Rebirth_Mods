    <description>[h1]Description[/h1]
This mod gives you a hint in order to find secret / super secret / ultra secret rooms / crawlspaces / black markets more easily.

[h1]How it works[/h1]
[b][u]Secret / Super Secret Rooms:[/u][/b] every time you enter a room, if there is a Secret / Super Secret Room entrance, you have 10% probability to see a new [b][u]light-blue[/u][/b] wisp (near the wall you should bomb).

[b][u]Ultra Secret Rooms:[/u][/b] every time you enter a room, if you have either a Red Key, a Craked Key or a Soul of Cain and there is a Ultra Secret Room near you (max 1-2 rooms distance), you have 10% probability to see a new [b][u]red[/u][/b] wisp.

[b][u]Crawlspaces / Black Markets:[/u][/b] every time you enter a room, if under a rock there is a trapdoor that leads to a crawlspace, you have 10% probability to see a new [b][u]purple[/u][/b] wisp.
^^^due to latest update these wisps do not spawn correctly. Sorry. New update with a fix asap

[b][u]Note[/u][/b]: every point of luck will increase the probability of seeing a wisp by 5%.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[b]Repentance[/b] (tested)
[b]Afterbirth+[/b] (NOT tested but it should work)
[b]Afterbirth+[/b] for MAC OS (it does NOT work)

[b]Mod Config Menu[/b]

- McM: you can set the probability for the wisps (base and bonus probability)
